# [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

I've already written a brief article about this which should show you how much I recommend it. It is an extreme pain in the ass to use but if you're on this site I assume you're used to that type of thing so it shouldn't be too much of an issue for you.

# [QubesOS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)

QubesOS allows for the utmost privacy, only being outclassed by just throwing your computer away and living in the woods. It functions on a system of qubes which are virtualized and isolated compartments which can run whatever you want.

# [Void](https://voidlinux.org/)

Void is a minimal distro built from scratch using runit instead of Systemd. Void also gives you the option to use muscl instead of glibc for an even more minimal setup.

# [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)

Arch is the least complex distro here however it's still good. It's another minimal distro thats notable for its large amount of packages and its unecessarily complex install.

# A condemnation of Gentoo

Don't be fooled, Gentoo is a purposeless distro used by people with far too much free time to seem smarter and better, it provides no benefit over any other distro and only serves to double your electricity bill.
