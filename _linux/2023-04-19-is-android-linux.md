# The Answer

Kinda?

# The Introduction

Unsatisfying answer I know but this really depends on what you define as "Linux". If we're using the very literal definition then yes, Android is Linux as it uses the Linux kernel. HOWEVER when most people say "Linux" they're usually referring to more than the kernel, they're also referring to the userland.

# The Userland

Androids userland is extremely broad and extremely different from Linux OS's. Android does not use GNU while most Linux OS's do. Android is very locked down to the user while Linux is very open. Android is intended for mobile devices whereas Linux OS's are usually intended for servers or desktops. Almost all Linux OS's are FOSS whereas AOSP is the only FOSS Android OS. Android has a different directory structure from most Linux OS's. Etc etc etc you get my point. These userlands are extremely different and serve extremely different purposes, you wouldn't use CentOS on a phone and you wouldn't use Android on a server. 

# The Development

AOSP is a FOSS Android OS and the base version of it used by all other Android OS's. And while it is FOSS, it is mostly contributed to by Google. And dont forget that almost every other Android OS, the ones that people actually use, are completely proprietary. 

# The Conclusion

If you want to be technical then yes, Android is Linux as it uses the Linux kernel, however I believe that Android is NOT Linux. While Android may be based on Linux, it is not Linux as it follows a massively different philosphy, functions very differently, and has a very different use case. This would be very similar to the original BSD, it may have been based on Unix however it was not UNIX as it functioned differently, was developed differently, and was intended to be used differently.
