# Introduction

All across the globe, nations are spreading misinformation and propaganda to advance both the agendas of their nation and allies. Throughout this article I will explain the tools used by these nations.

# The West

You may ask why I'm splitting this into 2 sections, the reason is simple, the UN and EU used very different strategies from BRICS and allied nations. Generally, the west is extremely anti-Palestine, anti-Arab and Islamaphobic (though that shouldn't come as a surprise).

## Ignorance is Bliss

The primary tool of the west is pretending that Israel simply does not exist. When Israel is brought up in conversation and they aren't being shown as the victim, they quickly move away from it. Discussions of [Israeli funding](https://www.bbc.com/news/57170576) are shot down, discussions of their [war crimes in Palestine](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/photos-israelstrikes-pediatric-hospital-in-gaza-injures-palestinian-child) are disregarded, and the [violent subduing of protests](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-protests-idUSKCN1QB26U) is passed off as policing.

## Antisemitism

A tactic far more common in the EU (though it still happens in the U.S) is simply calling detractors of Israel antisemites and Nazis. Even though you are criticizing the state of Israel and not any made up characteristics of Jews, [they will claim you to be a bigot](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/opinion/ilhan-omar-israel-jews.html).

## The 2 State Solution

The 2 state solution, while an ideal solution, is simply not realistic. It is frequently pushed by the moderate-presenting elites as a real solution, saying that if Palestinians simply stop fighting for their freedom, they will get it. This narrative is used to subtly push the idea that the Palestine is in the wrong and that Israel is in the right.

# The East

The tactics of the east (namely BRICS) is very different from those of the west. However, they are just as Islamaphobic as the west and simply wish to advance their own agenda.

## Condemnation of the West

The east will claim to be anti-western and as Israel is a westernized nation, anti-Israel. While true, it is simply a tool used to bolster nationalist sentiment and support for the current administration similar to what is happening with Russia v. Ukraine.

## Fake Support for Liberation

Many eastern leaders have released statements feigning support for Palestine and Islam in general
["We have always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights"](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/14/chinas-xi-jinping-backs-just-cause-of-palestinian-statehood) -Xi Jingping
This phony support is simply being used to create support for eastern intervention in Palestine (and the Middle East as a whole) in order to advance their economic imperialism [as has been happening in Africa](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/takeover-trap-why-imperialist-china-invading-africa-66421).

# The Conclusion

It is clear to me that this war is not simply a struggle for national liberation, but also a class struggle. The elites of the world are using the plight of the Palestinian workers as a way to advance their oppression, the only true solution is one created and advanced by the workers.
